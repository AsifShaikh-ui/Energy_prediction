⚡ Energy Consumption Optimization (ML-Based Prediction)

📘 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting household energy consumption patterns using machine learning.
The main goal is to understand energy usage trends and build a model that can optimize power consumption for better efficiency.
Currently, Phase 1 (Data Cleaning & Preprocessing) has been completed.
Upcoming phases include feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

🧩 Phase 1 – Data Understanding & Preprocessing
✔ Tasks Completed:
Data loading and inspection
Handling missing values
Type conversion and datetime parsing
Hourly data resampling
Feature extraction (hour, day, month, weekday, etc.)
Outlier and distribution analysis
Correlation heatmap and visualization
Feature encoding and scaling
